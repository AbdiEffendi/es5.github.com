<h1>Annotated ECMAScript 5</h1>
<p>This repo holds a document that provides an annotated HTML view
of ECMA 262, the
<cite>ECMAScript Language Specification, 5th edition</cite>. It is
<b>not</b> a normative version of the ECMAScript spec. Though it
does include the <b>full text</b> of the spec, it is in fact a
completely <b>non-normative</b> derivative work <i>based on</i>
the spec—strictly for the purpose of explaining the spec and
assisting in its implementation.</p>

<p>No copyright is currently asserted on the annotations that are
part of the <cite>Annotated ECMAScript 5</cite> document. But the
non-annotations part of the document is entirely verbatim text
from the spec—used under the terms of that document’s
<a href="spec.html#copyright">copyright notice</a> and
<a href="spec.html#license">license statement</a>—so reuse of any
non-annotation content from the <cite>Annotated ECMAScript 5</cite>
document must also adhere to the terms of that license.</p>
