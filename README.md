# About

This is intended to become an annotated reference to the Fifth Edition of the
ECMAScript Language Specification, **in HTML**.

It is awaiting the addition of annotationsâ€”but because it is an **HTML**
document and does actually contain the full text of the ES5 spec, it can be
used a **non-normative** reference to the spec by anybody who prefers to read
the spec content **in HTML** rather than in a PDF or Word document.

## IMPORTANT

This document is _not_ the ES5 spec. It is a completely **non-normative**
_derivative work_, as permitted by copyright notice on the spec, which reads
in part:

> This draft document may be copied and furnished to others, and derivative
works that comment on or otherwise explain it or assist in its implementation
may be prepared, copied, published, and distributed, in whole or in part,
without restriction of any kind, provided that the above copyright notice and
this section are included on all such copies and derivative works.
