# Annotated ECMAScript 5

This repo holds a document that provides an annotated HTML view of ECMA 262,
the ECMAScript Language Specification, 5th edition. It is **not** a normative
version of the ECMAScript spec. Though it does include the **full text** of
the spec, it is in fact a completely **non-normative** derivative work _based
on_ the spec—strictly for the purpose of explaining the spec and assisting in
its implementation.

No copyright is currently asserted on the annotations that are part of the
Annotated ECMAScript 5 document. But the non-annotations part of the document
is entirely verbatim text from the spec—used under the terms of that
document’s [copyright notice][1] and [license statement][2]—so reuse of any
non-annotation content from the Annotated ECMAScript 5 document must also
adhere to the terms of that license.
