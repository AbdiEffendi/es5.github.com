## Important

It is important to note that Annotated ECMAScript 5 is **not** a normative
version of the ECMAScript spec. Though it does include the **full text** of
the spec, it is in fact a completely **non-normative** derivative work _based
on_ the spec—strictly for the purpose of explaining the spec and assisting in
its implementation.
