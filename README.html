<h1>About</h1>

<p>This main HTML document in this repo is intended to become an
annotated reference to the Fifth Edition of the ECMAScript
Language Specification, <b>in HTML</b>.</p>

<p>It is awaiting the addition of annotationsâ€”but because it is an
<b>HTML</b> document and does actually contain the full text of
the ES5 spec, it can be used a <b>non-normative</b> reference to
the spec by anybody who prefers to read the spec content
<b>in HTML</b> rather than in a PDF or Word document.</p>

<H2>IMPORTANT</H2>

<p>This document is <i>not</i> the ES5 spec. It is a completely
<b>non-normative</b> <i>derivative work</i>, as permitted by
the copyright notice on the spec, which reads in part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This draft document may be copied and furnished to others,
  and derivative works that comment on or otherwise explain it or
  assist in its implementation may be prepared, copied, published,
  and distributed, in whole or in part, without restriction of any
  kind, provided that the above copyright notice and this section
  are included on all such copies and derivative works.</p>
