<h2>Important</h2>
It is important to note that <cite>Annotated ECMAScript 5</cite>
is <b>not</b> a normative version of the ECMAScript spec. Though
it does include the <b>full text</b> of the spec, it is in fact a
completely <b>non-normative</b> derivative work <i>based on</i>
the spec—strictly for the purpose of explaining the spec and
assisting in its implementation.</p>
